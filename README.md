# Sudoku
Here is a little sudoku application. This is not a tool or a solution to a problematic, just a small project to familiarize with Tauri.

## features
Yet the application is not finished, I still working on it for now, but when I'll considere that there is nothing left to learn from it, I'm gonna move on another bigger project.

Here is a list of the current and potencial futurs features :
### currently avaiable :
- you can set, remove or change the numbers by clicking on the case, for the keyboards inputs, refer to [shortcuts](#shortcuts)
- you can put an existing sudoku and resolve it, it can be very slow particularly for these created to resist to a sudoku algorithm (this one is just some brutforcing, it can be improved so much)

### Maybe one day :
- themes of color for any sort of monster who like light mode
- a better algorithm to improve the performances
- logicals shortcuts (who knows ?)

## Shortcuts
Here is a list of the current shortcuts (this more for the developper than the user, it is quick and random, not logic, maybe changed one day ???)
- the mouse `left click` to select a square
- `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9` (from the number pad or the regular keyboard) to set and change the selected square's number
- `return` or `delete` to remove the number
- `d` to solve the sudoku
